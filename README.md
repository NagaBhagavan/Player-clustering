# Player Classification Using Random Forest Machine Learning Model

**Overview:**  
This project aims to classify players based on their attributes and performance metrics using a Random Forest machine learning model. The classification helps in identifying player positions or skill levels, providing valuable insights for team management and scouting purposes.

**Key Features:**  
- **Machine Learning Model:** Utilizes the Random Forest algorithm for player classification.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handles missing values, encodes categorical variables, and scales numerical features.
- **Feature Engineering:** Extracts relevant features and potentially creates new ones to enhance model performance.
- **Ensemble Learning:** Leverages ensemble learning to combine multiple decision trees for improved accuracy.
- **Python Implementation:** Implemented in Python, utilizing scikit-learn and pandas libraries.
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluates model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.
- **Data Visualization:** Visualizes data distributions, feature importance, and model performance metrics.
