Data Collection and Preprocessing:
Collect the data about players (e.g., statistics, performance metrics).
Preprocess the data (e.g., handle missing values, normalize data).
Feature Engineering:
Select relevant features that might influence player classification.
Transform or engineer features if necessary.
Split Data into Training and Testing Sets:
Split the data into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.
Model Building:
Use the Random Forest algorithm to build the classification model.
Train the model using the training data.
Model Evaluation:
Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, etc., on the testing data.
Save the Model:
Once satisfied with the model's performance, save it to a file.
